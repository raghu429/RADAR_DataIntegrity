# # #** This piece of code contants methods to visualize the following
# RMSE plots for multiple values of the R matrix and radar data generator sigma
# A route display and the predicted value display for the original and encoded data
# List of plots for the paper
# 1. six plots: Three plots each for px, py: RMSE for clean and encoded frames at different variances of the R matrix (x axis) and generator data (y-axis) for a given step size
# 2. Localization accuracy box plots for multiple runs of same data at different noise sigmas on x-axis (step <threshold, ==threshold, > threshold)
# one for each (delete, add and modify)
# 3. BER box plots for different data frames at different stepsizes
# 4. False alaram rate of different frames at different step sizes
# 5. prediction sample: GT, prediction without encoding and with encoding)
