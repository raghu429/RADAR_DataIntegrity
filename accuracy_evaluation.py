# #** This piece of code contants methods to evaluate the 2D QIM embedding for the given Udacity data-set. We can further split this file into three different files if needed (most of the previously developed code could be re-used)
# First - read the data file and generate a separate binary file with just the radar data
# Add noise to the data if required (uniform or Gaussian with variable delta)
# simulate the attack vectors, like add, delete or modify the random line items in the above generated file
# get the detections out of the modified files and report the false alarms, error rate and accuracy (if the algorithm is able to detect the location of the modified data)
